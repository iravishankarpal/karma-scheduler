> **Pancha Pakshi** is a traditional South Indian astrological system that assigns each person a guiding birdâ€”Vulture, Owl, Crow, Cock, or Peacockâ€”based on their birth details.

> Each bird cycles through five dynamic states (Ruling, Eating, Walking, Sleeping, Dying), determining auspicious times for actions. This system adds a cosmic rhythm to personal

> decision-making and planning.
